    "\n",
    "#### Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's busy and fast paced life, everyone wants a quick escape every now and then in form of a holiday. However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the holiday planning daunting. To address this, we have developed **TravelAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given a dataset containing information about holiday packages (Package name, destination, No. of days, Sighseeing etc.), build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate holiday recommendations based on user requirements*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "Data is gathered form Kaggle's make my trip dataset on holiday package from the follwing link: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/travel-listing-from-makemytrip' \n",
    "\n",
    "Original dataset contained 30k rows, however for this problem statement this has been trimmed down to just 4 rows.\n",

    "#### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation and Information Gathering**: The chatbot will utilize language models to understand and generate natural responses. Through a conversational flow, it will ask relevant questions to gather information about the user's requirements.\n",
    "2. **Information Extraction**: Once the essential information is collected, rule-based functions come into play, extracting relevant holiday packages that best matches the user's needs.\n",
    "3. **Personalized Recommendation**: Leveraging this extracted information, the chatbot engages in further dialogue with the user, efficiently addressing their queries and aiding them in answering any question related to the package."

    "- `intent_confirmation_layer()`: This function takes the assistant's response and evaluates if the chatbot has captured the user's profile clearly. Specifically, this checks if the following properties for the user has been captured or not 'Destination','Package','Origin','Duration','Budget'\n",
    "- `dictionary_present()`: This function checks if the final understanding of user's profile is returned by the chatbot as a python dictionary or not. If there is a dictionary, it extracts the information as a Python dictionary.\n",
    "- `compare_holiday_with_user()`: This function compares the user's requirements with the different holiday packages and come back with the top 3 recommendations.\n",
